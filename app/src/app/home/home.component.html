    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>the purpose or objective of the assignment is to create a web API and an Angular app that has good coverage of the topics in the course.

      The app’s purpose is to define or translate the English-language terminology we use in the computer programming courses in the School of SDDS, for use by all students, whether or not English is a student’s first language.
      
      We have so many students who are learning English and computer programming at the same time, and that is a challenging combination. The technical terminology is often unclear, complicated, and sometimes isn’t explained well. For example, when we say “asynchronous”, what does it clearly mean in English, as well as in a student’s first language?</p>
